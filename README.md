## 3. .NET Core Backend API & MVC Implementation

*(Detailed explanation as per original expansion)*

*   3.1. Project Structure & Layering (Onion/Clean Architecture)
*   3.2. API Design Philosophy (RESTful, Versioning)
*   3.3. Controller Design Patterns
    *   **Summary:** Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, validate input using DTOs and FluentValidation, call appropriate services, and return HTTP responses. Uses attribute routing and `async/await`.
    *   *(Detailed explanation)*
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Simplified .NET Controller Example
        [ApiController]
        [Route("api/v1/[controller]")] // Versioned routing
        [Authorize] // Requires authentication
        public class TransactionsController : ControllerBase
        {
            private readonly ITransactionService _service;
            private readonly ILogger<TransactionsController> _logger;

            public TransactionsController(ITransactionService service, ILogger<TransactionsController> logger) // DI
            {
                _service = service;
                _logger = logger;
            }

            // GET /api/v1/transactions/summaries
            [HttpGet("summaries")]
            [ProducesResponseType(typeof(IEnumerable<CrossBorderSummary>), StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
            [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized)]
            public async Task<IActionResult> GetSummaries()
            {
                _logger.LogInformation("Fetching daily summaries.");
                var summaries = await _service.GetDailySummariesAsync();
                return Ok(summaries);
            }

            // POST /api/v1/transactions/crossborder
            [HttpPost("crossborder")]
            [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] // CSRF protection for state-changing POSTs if using cookies/session
            [Authorize(Roles = "CIBC_CrossBorder,CIBC_Analyst")] // Role-based authorization
            [ProducesResponseType(typeof(ProcessResult), StatusCodes.Status201Created)]
            [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)]
            [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized)]
            [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden)]
            public async Task<IActionResult> ProcessCrossBorder([FromBody] CrossBorderRequest request)
            {
                 // FluentValidation is typically wired up via middleware or action filters
                 if (!ModelState.IsValid)
                 {
                    _logger.LogWarning("Invalid cross-border request received: {ModelState}", ModelState);
                    return BadRequest(ModelState);
                 }

                 _logger.LogInformation("Processing cross-border request {RequestId}", request.RequestId); // Use a unique request ID if available
                 var result = await _service.ProcessAsync(request);

                 if (!result.IsSuccess)
                 {
                    _logger.LogError("Cross-border request processing failed: {Reason}", result.Message);
                    // Return appropriate error (e.g., BadRequest, Conflict, etc.) based on result
                    return BadRequest(new { message = result.Message });
                 }

                 _logger.LogInformation("Cross-border request {RequestId} processed successfully, TransactionId: {TransactionId}", request.RequestId, result.TransactionId);
                 // Return 201 Created with location header and result body
                 return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetTransactionById), new { id = result.TransactionId }, result);
            }

            // GET /api/v1/transactions/{id}
            [HttpGet("{id:guid}")] // Route constraint
            [ProducesResponseType(typeof(TransactionDetails), StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
            [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound)]
            [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized)]
            public async Task<IActionResult> GetTransactionById(Guid id)
            {
                 _logger.LogInformation("Fetching transaction details for Id: {TransactionId}", id);
                 var transaction = await _service.GetTransactionDetailsAsync(id);
                 if (transaction == null)
                 {
                     _logger.LogWarning("Transaction not found for Id: {TransactionId}", id);
                     return NotFound();
                 }
                 return Ok(transaction);
            }
        }
        ```
*   3.4. Service Layer & Business Logic
    *   **Summary:** Contains core logic, orchestrates repository calls, performs calculations/validations. Uses Dependency Injection (DI) to get dependencies like repositories.
    *   *(Detailed explanation)*
    *   **Example:** (See `TransactionService` example in section 8.2)
*   3.5. Middleware Pipeline
    *   **Summary:** Sequential components processing requests/responses for logging, error handling, auth, etc.
    *   *(Detailed explanation)*
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A[Incoming HTTP Request] --> B(Exception Handling Middleware);
            B --> C(HTTPS Redirection Middleware);
            C --> D(Static File Middleware - Optional);
            D --> E(Routing Middleware);
            E --> F(CORS Middleware);
            F --> G(Authentication Middleware);
            G --> H(Authorization Middleware);
            H --> I(Request Logging Middleware - Start);
            I --> J(Endpoint Execution - Controller);
            J --> K(Request Logging Middleware - End);
            K --> L(Response Compression Middleware);
            L --> M[Outgoing HTTP Response];
        ```

## 4. Entity Framework Core & LINQ Integration

*(Detailed explanation as per original expansion)*

*   4.1. Data Modeling & Entity Design
*   4.2. DbContext Configuration (`CibcDbContext`)
*   4.3. Repository Pattern Implementation
    *   **Summary:** Abstracts data access using interfaces (like `ITransactionRepository`), hiding EF Core details from the service layer.
    *   *(Detailed explanation)*
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Repository Interface Example
        public interface ITransactionRepository
        {
            Task<Transaction?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id);
            Task<List<CrossBorderSummary>> GetDailySummariesAsync();
            Task<List<Transaction>> GetRecentHighValueTransactionsAsync(decimal threshold);
            Task<Transaction> AddAsync(Transaction transaction);
            Task UpdateAsync(Transaction transaction); // If updates are needed
            Task<bool> SaveChangesAsync(); // Often part of Unit of Work
        }

        // Implementation using EF Core
        public class TransactionRepository : ITransactionRepository
        {
            private readonly CibcDbContext _context;

            public TransactionRepository(CibcDbContext context) // Inject DbContext
            {
                _context = context;
            }

            public async Task<List<CrossBorderSummary>> GetDailySummariesAsync()
            {
                // Example from original prompt
                return await _context.Transactions
                    .Where(t => t.Timestamp >= DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1))
                    .GroupBy(t => t.CurrencyPair)
                    .Select(g => new CrossBorderSummary
                    {
                        CurrencyPair = g.Key,
                        TotalAmount = g.Sum(t => t.Amount),
                        AverageSettlementTime = g.Average(t => t.SettlementMs)
                    })
                    .AsNoTracking() // Read-only optimization
                    .ToListAsync();
            }

            public async Task<List<Transaction>> GetRecentHighValueTransactionsAsync(decimal threshold)
            {
                 return await _context.Transactions
                    .Where(t => t.Timestamp >= DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-7) && t.Amount > threshold)
                    .OrderByDescending(t => t.Timestamp)
                    .Include(t => t.Client) // Example of loading related data
                    .AsNoTracking()
                    .ToListAsync();
            }

            public async Task<Transaction> AddAsync(Transaction transaction)
            {
                await _context.Transactions.AddAsync(transaction);
                // SaveChangesAsync often called separately by Unit of Work or Service
                return transaction;
            }

            // ... other methods ...

            public async Task<bool> SaveChangesAsync()
            {
                return (await _context.SaveChangesAsync()) > 0;
            }
        }
        ```
*   4.4. LINQ Query Optimization Strategies
    *   **Summary:** Use `Select` for projections, `AsNoTracking()` for reads, `Include`/`ThenInclude` carefully to avoid N+1, filter early (`Where`).
    *   *(Detailed explanation)*
*   4.5. Database Transaction Management
*   4.6. EF Core Migrations & Schema Management

## 5. UI/UX Design Strategy (React Frontend)

*(Detailed explanation as per original expansion)*

*   5.1. Frontend Technology Stack
    *   **React:** Build UI components.
    *   **TypeScript:** Add types for robustness.
    *   **UI Library (MUI/Fluent):** Consistent look & feel, faster dev.
    *   **State Management (Redux/Zustand):** Manage shared data.
    *   **React Router:** Handle in-app navigation.
    *   *(Detailed explanation)*
    *   **Example (React Component):**
        ```typescript
        // Simplified React Component Example (Fraud Alert)
        import React from 'react';
        import { Paper, Typography, LinearProgress, Button, Tooltip } from '@mui/material'; // Example using MUI
        // Assume RiskIcon is another component and useStyles provides CSS classes

        interface FraudAlertProps {
          riskScore: number; // e.g., 0.0 to 1.0
          transactionId: string;
          onInvestigate: (txId: string) => void;
        }

        const FraudAlert: React.FC<FraudAlertProps> = ({ riskScore, transactionId, onInvestigate }) => {
          // Assume const { classes } = useStyles(); is defined

          const handleInvestigateClick = () => {
            onInvestigate(transactionId);
          };

          return (
            <Paper elevation={3} /* className={classes.root} */ >
              <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
                {/* <RiskIcon score={riskScore} /> */} {/* Assuming RiskIcon component */}
                Transaction Risk Assessment
              </Typography>
              <LinearProgress
                 variant="determinate"
                 value={riskScore * 100} // Convert score to percentage
                 color={riskScore > 0.8 ? "error" : riskScore > 0.5 ? "warning" : "success"}
                 // className={classes.progress}
              />
              <Typography variant="body2">
                Risk Score: {(riskScore * 100).toFixed(0)}%
              </Typography>
              <Tooltip title="Risk factors: amount, location history, device fingerprint, velocity checks">
                <Button variant="outlined" color="secondary" onClick={handleInvestigateClick}>
                  Investigation Console
                </Button>
              </Tooltip>
            </Paper>
          );
        };

        export default FraudAlert;
        ```
*   5.2. Component Architecture & Design Principles
*   5.3. State Management Strategy
*   5.4. API Interaction Layer
    *   **Summary:** Standardized code (using Fetch/Axios) for making API calls from React to the .NET backend.
    *   *(Detailed explanation)*
    *   **Example (API Call):**
        ```typescript
        // Simplified API Call Example (using fetch)
        async function fetchTransactionDetails(transactionId: string) {
          const apiUrl = `/api/v1/transactions/${transactionId}`; // Use environment variable for base URL ideally
          try {
            const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
              method: 'GET',
              headers: {
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}`, // Assume function gets JWT token
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'

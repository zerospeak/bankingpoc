7.  **CI/CD Pipeline (Azure DevOps)**
    *   7.1. Pipeline Philosophy & Goals
        *   **Goals:** Automate build, testing, security scanning, and deployment processes to ensure rapid, reliable, and secure delivery of new features and fixes. Minimize manual intervention, reduce deployment risk, and provide full traceability from code commit to production deployment.
        *   **Philosophy:** Embrace Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for environment provisioning, implement comprehensive automated testing at multiple levels, enforce security gates, and utilize progressive deployment strategies.
    *   7.2. Azure DevOps Pipeline Structure (YAML)
        *   **Repository Structure:** Typically a multi-repo setup (e.g., `cibc-crossborder-api`, `cibc-crossborder-ui`, `cibc-crossborder-infra`) or a mono-repo with distinct pipeline triggers based on path filters.
        *   **YAML Pipelines:** Defined using `azure-pipelines.yml` files co-located with the code, enabling version control and review of the pipeline definition itself.
        *   **Multi-Stage Pipelines:** Utilizing stages for logical separation (e.g., Build, Test, Security Scan, Deploy Dev, Deploy QA, Deploy Staging, Deploy Prod). Dependencies between stages ensure sequential execution and quality gates.
        *   **Templates:** Reusable YAML templates for common tasks (e.g., .NET build, Node.js build, security scan configuration, deployment steps) to ensure consistency and reduce duplication across pipelines.
    *   7.3. Build Stage
        *   **Backend (.NET Core):**
            *   `dotnet restore`: Fetches NuGet dependencies.
            *   `dotnet build`: Compiles the application code (Release configuration).
            *   `dotnet publish`: Creates deployment artifacts (including dependencies).
            *   Versioning: Stamp artifacts with build number/semantic version.
        *   **Frontend (React):**
            *   `npm ci` or `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`: Installs Node.js dependencies reliably.
            *   `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Transpiles TypeScript, bundles JavaScript/CSS, optimizes assets for production.
            *   Versioning: Embed build information if needed.
        *   **Artifact Publishing:** Securely publish build artifacts (e.g., zipped API deployment package, static UI assets) to Azure Artifacts or pipeline artifacts storage for consumption by subsequent stages.
    *   7.4. Testing Stages
        *   **Unit Tests:**
            *   Backend: `dotnet test` executing xUnit/NUnit tests. Code coverage reports generated (e.g., using Coverlet) and published.
            *   Frontend: `npm test` or `yarn test` executing Jest/React Testing Library tests. Coverage reports generated and published.
            *   **Gate:** Fail the pipeline if tests fail or if code coverage drops below a defined threshold (e.g., 85% line coverage).
        *   **Integration Tests:**
            *   Executed against ephemeral or dedicated test environments (spun up via IaC if possible).
            *   Tests interactions between API components, database, and potentially external services (using mocks or test doubles where appropriate).
            *   Focus on data flow, service interactions, and repository logic.
        *   **API Contract Tests (Pact - Optional):** Ensure compatibility between the React UI (consumer) and the .NET API (provider) without requiring full end-to-end testing for every change.
        *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
            *   Using frameworks like Playwright or Cypress to simulate user interactions in a deployed environment (typically QA or Staging).
            *   Validate critical user flows (e.g., submitting a cross-border transaction, viewing summaries, accessing fraud console).
        *   **Performance Tests:**
            *   **Azure Load Testing:** Integrated task (`AzureLoadTest@1`) executing predefined load test scripts (e.g., JMeter, YAML-based).
            *   **Scenarios:** Simulate realistic user loads, peak loads, stress tests.
            *   **Metrics:** Monitor API response times, throughput (RPS), error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, database DTU/RU).
            *   **Gate:** Fail the pipeline if performance degrades beyond acceptable thresholds (e.g., average response time > 150ms under load, error rate > 0.1%).
            *   **Ramp-up:** Gradual increase in load (e.g., `rampUpTime: '00:05:00'`) to simulate realistic traffic patterns.
    *   7.5. Security Validation Stage
        *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
            *   Tools: Integrated scanners like SonarCloud, Snyk Code, or built-in Azure DevOps security scanning tasks (`SecurityAnalysis@2`).
            *   Configuration: Use custom rulesets aligned with CIBC security standards and OWASP Top 10 (e.g., `ruleset: 'CIBC-SecureBanking'`).
            *   Targets: Scan `.cs`, `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.js` files for potential vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, insecure configuration, etc.).
            *   **Gate:** Fail the pipeline if critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are detected.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**
            *   Tools: Snyk Open Source, OWASP Dependency-Check, GitHub Dependabot.
            *   Process: Scan `packages.config`, `.csproj`, `package.json`, `yarn.lock` for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
            *   **Gate:** Fail the pipeline if dependencies with critical vulnerabilities are found without approved exceptions.
        *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST - Optional in CI/CD):** Can be integrated, but often run periodically against deployed environments due to time constraints. Tools like OWASP ZAP can be scripted.
        *   **Secrets Scanning:** Tools like `git-secrets` or integrated scanners to prevent accidental commits of credentials or API keys.
    *   7.6. Deployment Stages (Dev, QA, Staging, Prod)
        *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
            *   Tools: ARM Templates, Bicep, or Terraform.
            *   Process: Define Azure resources (App Services, SQL DB, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, etc.) in code. Pipelines validate and apply IaC changes before application deployment. Ensures consistent and repeatable environments.
        *   **Deployment Strategy:**
            *   **Dev/QA:** Direct deployment or recreate environment.
            *   **Staging/Prod:** Progressive exposure strategies are critical.
                *   **Canary Deployment:** Route a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 5% via Azure App Service deployment slots or Azure Front Door/Application Gateway traffic weighting) to the new version. Monitor health and performance closely. Gradually increase traffic if stable.
                *   **Blue/Green Deployment:** Deploy the new version to a separate, identical environment ("Blue"). Switch traffic instantly once validated. Provides immediate rollback capability by switching back to "Green". Implemented using deployment slots with swap.
        *   **Approval Gates:** Manual approval steps required before deployment to sensitive environments (Staging, Production), involving stakeholders like Release Managers, Security Officers, or Product Owners.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use Azure App Configuration or Key Vault references for environment-specific settings. Avoid storing secrets directly in pipeline variables.
        *   **Database Migrations:** Integrate EF Core database migration scripts (`dotnet ef database update`) into the deployment pipeline, often requiring careful sequencing and potential manual oversight for production. Consider strategies for zero-downtime database deployments.
    *   7.7. Rollback & Monitoring
        *   **Automated Rollback:** Configure pipelines to automatically trigger a rollback (e.g., swap back deployment slots, redeploy previous artifact version) if post-deployment health checks fail or key monitoring alerts fire within a specified timeframe.
        *   **Health Checks:** Implement ASP.NET Core Health Checks (`/healthz` endpoint) validating critical dependencies (database connectivity, external services). Integrate these checks into Azure App Service monitoring and pipeline deployment gates.
        *   **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Closely monitor Application Insights dashboards, Azure Monitor alerts, and logs immediately following a deployment.

8.  **Unit & Integration Testing Strategy**
    *   8.1. Testing Philosophy
        *   **Test Pyramid:** Emphasize a large base of fast unit tests, a smaller layer of integration tests, and a minimal set of E2E tests. Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices where feasible, writing tests before or alongside production code.
        *   **Goal:** Ensure code correctness, prevent regressions, facilitate refactoring, and provide living documentation of system behavior. Achieve high confidence in code quality before merging and deployment.
    *   8.2. Backend Testing (.NET Core / C#)
        *   **Framework:** xUnit (preferred for its parallel execution and modern features) or NUnit.
        *   **Assertion Library:** FluentAssertions (provides more readable and expressive assertions compared to default framework assertions).
        *   **Mocking Framework:** Moq (popular and flexible) or NSubstitute (simpler syntax for some use cases). Used to isolate the System Under Test (SUT) from its dependencies (repositories, services, external APIs).
        *   **Unit Test Focus:**
            *   **Controllers:** Verify routing, authorization attributes, model validation handling, correct service method calls, and appropriate `IActionResult` return types (e.g., `OkObjectResult`, `BadRequestObjectResult`, `NotFoundResult`). Mock dependencies like services.
            *   **Services:** Test business logic, calculations, decision paths, exception handling. Mock repositories and other dependencies.
            *   **Repositories:** Often tested via integration tests due to their direct dependency on EF Core and the database context. Unit tests might cover complex LINQ expression building logic if abstracted.
            *   **Utilities/Helpers:** Test pure functions and algorithms.
        *   **Example (Service Test with Moq & FluentAssertions):**
            ```csharp
            using Moq;
            using FluentAssertions;
            using Xunit;
            // using relevant namespaces for services, models, exceptions

Test `SaveChanges` behavior, transaction handling. Use test databases (e.g., LocalDB, SQLite in-memory mode - with limitations, or a dedicated Azure SQL test instance).
            *   **API Endpoint Tests:** Use `WebApplicationFactory` from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` to test the full request pipeline (middleware, routing, model binding, controller execution, response formatting) without needing a separate web server process. Interact with endpoints using an `HttpClient` provided by the factory.
    *   8.3. Frontend Testing (React / TypeScript)
        *   **Framework:** Jest (popular test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities).
        *   **Component Testing Library:** React Testing Library (encourages testing components the way users interact with them, focusing on accessibility and behavior rather than implementation details).
        *   **E2E Framework:** Playwright or Cypress (for testing user flows across multiple components/pages).
        *   **Unit Test Focus:**
            *   **Components:** Verify rendering based on props, user interactions (clicks, input changes), conditional rendering logic, calls to prop functions. Use `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent` from React Testing Library. Mock child components or external hooks if needed.
            *   **Hooks:** Test custom hook logic in isolation using `@testing-library/react-hooks` (or directly if simple).
            *   **State Management (Redux/Zustand):** Test reducers/slices (pure functions), selectors, and potentially async thunks/actions by mocking API calls.
            *   **Utilities:** Test formatting functions, validation logic, etc.
        *   **Example (React Component Test with RTL & Jest):**
            ```typescript
            import React from 'react';
            import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
            import '@testing-library/jest-dom'; // for extended matchers like .toBeVisible()
            import FraudAlert from './FraudAlert'; // Assuming FraudAlert component exists

            // Mock child component if it's complex or makes external calls
            jest.mock('./RiskIcon', () => ({ score }: { score: number }) => <div data-testid="risk-icon">Risk: {score}</div>);
            // Mock styles hook if necessary
            jest.mock('./FraudAlert.styles', () => ({
              useStyles: () => ({ classes: { root: 'mockRoot', progress: 'mockProgress' } }),
            }));

            describe('FraudAlert Component', () => {
              const defaultProps = {
                riskScore: 0.75, // Example risk score (75%)
                onInvestigateClick: jest.fn(), // Mock callback prop
              };

              test('renders risk assessment title and icon', () => {
                render(<FraudAlert {...defaultProps} />);

                expect(screen.getByText(/Transaction Risk Assessment/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
                // Check mock icon rendering
                expect(screen.getByTestId('risk-icon')).toHaveTextContent('Risk: 0.75');
              });

              test('renders progress bar with correct value', () => {
                render(<FraudAlert {...defaultProps} />);
                const progressBar = screen.getByRole('progressbar');

                expect(progressBar).toBeInTheDocument();
                // Note: LinearProgress value might be aria-valuenow or a style transform depending on MUI version
                // This example assumes aria-valuenow is set appropriately
                expect(progressBar).toHaveAttribute('aria-valuenow', '75');
              });

              test('renders investigation button and tooltip', async () => {
                render(<FraudAlert {...defaultProps} />);
                const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /Investigation Console/i });

                expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();

                // Test tooltip (requires user interaction simulation)
                // Note: Tooltip testing can be tricky, depends on implementation (e.g., MUI Tooltip)
                // fireEvent.mouseOver(button); // Or focus
                // await screen.findByRole('tooltip'); // Wait for tooltip to appear
                // expect(screen.getByRole('tooltip')).toHaveTextContent(
                //   /Risk factors: amount, location history, device fingerprint/i
                // );
              });

              test('calls onInvestigateClick handler when button is clicked', () => {
                render(<FraudAlert {...defaultProps} />);
                const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /Investigation Console/i });

                fireEvent.click(button);

                expect(defaultProps.onInvestigateClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
              });
            });
            ```
    *   8.4. Test Coverage
        *   **Measurement:** Use tools like Coverlet (.NET) and Jest's built-in coverage reporting (often using Istanbul).
        *   **Metrics:** Track Line Coverage and Branch Coverage. Aim for high coverage (e.g., 85-90%+) on critical business logic (services, core components), but avoid targeting 100% purely for the metric's sake (diminishing returns).
        *   **Analysis:** Regularly review coverage reports (e.g., via SonarQube integration) to identify untested code paths, especially in complex logic or error handling scenarios.
        *   **Flaky Tests:** Monitor test execution reports (e.g., Azure Test Plans Analytics) to identify and fix flaky tests (tests that pass or fail intermittently without code changes). Aim for < 0.5% flaky tests.
    *   8.5. Test Data Management
        *   **Unit Tests:** Use hardcoded or generated mock data specific to the test case.
        *   **Integration/E2E Tests:** Requires more robust strategies. Options include:
            *   **Seed Scripts:** Scripts to populate test databases with known, consistent data before test runs.
            *   **Test Data Builders/Factories:** Code patterns (e.g., Builder pattern) to create complex test objects easily.
            *   **Data Generation Libraries:** Tools like Bogus (C#) or Faker.js (JS) to generate realistic-looking fake data.
            *   **Data Anonymization:** Use anonymized production data subsets in staging/test environments (requires careful handling to comply with privacy regulations).

9.  **Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting Strategy**
    *   9.1. Goals
        *   Provide deep visibility into application health, performance, and usage patterns.
        *   Enable rapid detection, diagnosis, and resolution of issues.
        *   Track key performance indicators (KPIs) and service level objectives (SLOs).
        *   Ensure comprehensive audit trails for security and compliance.
    *   9.2. Core Tools (Azure Monitor)
        *   **Application Insights:** APM service for monitoring the live web application. Automatically detects performance anomalies, includes powerful analytics tools. Integrated via SDKs (.NET & Node.js/Browser).
        *   **Log Analytics Workspace:** Central repository for logs and metrics from Application Insights, Azure resources (diagnostics settings), custom sources, and Azure Activity Logs. Enables complex querying using Kusto Query Language (KQL).
        *   **Azure Alerts:** Rule-based alerting based on metrics, log queries, activity logs, or application health checks.
    *   9.3. Logging Implementation
        *   **Backend (Serilog):**
            *   **Structured Logging:** Log events with key-value pairs, not just plain text strings. This enables powerful filtering and analysis in Log Analytics.
            *   **Sinks:** Configure Serilog to write to Console (for local dev/debugging) and Application Insights.
            *   **Enrichers:** Add contextual information automatically to all log events (e.g., ApplicationName, Environment, CorrelationId, UserId, RequestId).
            *   **Request Logging Middleware:** Log key details for each HTTP request (path, method, status code, duration).
            *   **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (Verbose, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal). Configure minimum levels per environment (e.g., Information in Prod, Debug in Dev).
        *   **Frontend (Application Insights SDK / Custom Logger):**
            *   Capture unhandled exceptions, track page views, custom events (e.g., button clicks, feature usage), and potentially API call telemetry.
            *   Correlate frontend logs with backend logs using operation IDs.
        *   **Log Content:** Avoid logging sensitive PII data unless absolutely necessary and properly secured/masked. Focus on event types, identifiers, status codes, durations, and error details.
    *   9.4. Monitoring & Metrics
        *   **Application Insights Standard Metrics:** Automatically collects server response time, server request rate, failed requests, CPU/memory utilization (via Azure App Service integration), dependency call durations (SQL, HTTP APIs), browser page load times.
        *   **Custom Metrics:** Track business-specific KPIs (e.g., `cross_border_transactions_processed`, `fraud_alerts_generated`, `average_settlement_time`) using the Application Insights SDK (`TelemetryClient.TrackMetric`).
        *   **Health Checks:** Implement ASP.NET Core Health Checks (`/healthz` endpoint) verifying connectivity to critical dependencies (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, essential external APIs). Configure Azure App Service to ping this endpoint.
        *   **Distributed Tracing:** Application Insights automatically correlates requests across services (Frontend -> Backend API -> Database) if the SDK is correctly configured in all tiers, providing end-to-end transaction visibility.
        *   **Dashboards:** Create Azure Dashboards visualizing key metrics, logs, and health status for different audiences (Ops, Dev, Business). Include charts for request rates, latency, error rates, resource usage, custom KPIs.
    *   9.5. Alerting Strategy
        *   **Metric Alerts:**
            *   High Server Response Time (e.g., > 500ms average over 5 min).
            *   High Failure Rate (e.g., > 1% HTTP 5xx errors over 5 min).
            *   High CPU/Memory Usage (e.g., > 85% sustained).
            *   Database DTU/RU Throttling.
        *   **Log Alerts (KQL Queries):**
            *   Specific critical errors (e.g., `exceptions | where severityLevel >= 3`).
            *   Security events (e.g., high rate of 401/403 responses, specific compliance rule failures).
            *   Business logic failures (e.g., query for logs indicating failed compliance checks).
        *   **Activity Log Alerts:** Critical Azure infrastructure events (e.g., resource deletion, configuration changes).
        *   **Health Check Alerts:** Alert if the `/healthz` endpoint fails or reports unhealthy status.
        *   **Action Groups:** Define recipients and actions for alerts (e.g., email CIBC Ops team, trigger Azure Function, send webhook to PagerDuty/Opsgenie for critical alerts, post to Teams channel).
        *   **Severity Levels:** Define alert severity (Sev 0-4) to guide response priority.
    *   9.6. Audit Logging
        *   Log critical business events and security-sensitive actions (e.g., login success/failure, PII access, configuration changes, high-value transaction processing, compliance overrides) to a dedicated, potentially immutable store (e.g., specific Log Analytics table with appropriate retention, or Azure Storage with immutability policies). Ensure audit logs contain user identity, timestamp, action performed, and outcome.

10. **Performance & Scalability Strategy**
    *   10.1. Performance Goals & Benchmarks
        *   **API Response Time:** Target P95 latency < 200ms for most reads, < 500ms for writes under typical load.
        *   **UI Load Time:** Target Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s, First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms.
        *   **Throughput:** Define target transactions per second/minute based on business projections (e.g., handle 1.2M daily transactions = ~14 transactions/sec average, peak potentially 5-10x higher).
        *   **Scalability:** System must scale horizontally to handle peak loads and future growth without significant performance degradation.
    *   10.2. Backend Scalability (.NET Core API)
        *   **Azure App Service Plan:** Use Premium tier plans for production, enabling auto-scaling based on metrics (CPU percentage, Memory percentage, HTTP queue length). Configure scale-out rules (increase instance count) and potentially scale-up rules (increase instance size, less common for web apps).
        *   **Stateless Design:** Ensure API instances are stateless. Store session state externally (e.g., Redis Cache) if required, though preferably design APIs to be truly stateless (using JWTs for auth state).
        *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilize `async`/`await` thoroughly for I/O-bound operations (database calls, external HTTP requests) to free up request threads and improve throughput.
        *   **Background Jobs:** Offload long-running or non-critical tasks (e.g., report generation, sending notifications) to background job frameworks (e.g., Azure Functions triggered by a queue, Hangfire, Azure WebJobs).
    *   10.3. Database Scalability
        *   **Azure SQL Hyperscale:** Chosen for its ability to scale storage (up to 100TB) and compute independently. Monitor DTU/vCore utilization and scale compute resources as needed. Read replicas can be used to offload read-heavy workloads.
        *   **Cosmos DB (Client Profiles):** Scales based on Request Units per second (RU/s). Utilize partitioning effectively (choose a good partition key, e.g., `clientId`) to distribute load evenly. Configure autoscale or manually provision RU/s based on monitored consumption. Optimize queries to minimize RU cost.
        *   **Query Optimization:** Continuously monitor slow queries (using Azure SQL Query Performance Insight, Application Insights dependency tracking, Cosmos DB metrics) and optimize indexes, LINQ queries, and data models.
    *   10.4. Frontend Performance
        *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Use Azure CDN to cache static assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts) geographically closer to users, reducing latency and server load.
        *   **Code Splitting:** Configure build tools (Vite/Webpack) to split the application bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand (e.g., per route or feature).
        *   **Lazy Loading:** Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to defer loading of components until they are needed.
        *   **Asset Optimization:** Compress images (WebP format), minify JS/CSS, use font subsets.
        *   **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` strategically to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
        *   **Efficient Data Fetching:** Use libraries like React Query or SWR for caching, request deduplication, and background updates. Avoid fetching excessive data.
    *   10.5. Caching Strategy
        *   **In-Memory Cache (API):** Use `IMemoryCache` for frequently accessed, relatively static data within a single API instance (e.g., configuration settings, lookup data). Be mindful of cache invalidation and consistency across instances.
        *   **Distributed Cache (Azure Cache for Redis):** Use for data that needs to be shared across multiple API instances or requires higher persistence/scalability than in-memory cache. Suitable for session state, API response caching, rate limiting counters, frequently accessed read data (e.g., user permissions, common reports). Choose appropriate tier (Basic, Standard, Premium) based on HA/performance needs. Implement cache-aside pattern.
        *   **Database-Level Caching:** EF Core second-level cache providers exist but require careful implementation. Often rely on Redis or other external caches instead.
        *   **HTTP Caching Headers:** Set appropriate `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified` headers on API responses (especially for GET requests) to allow browser and intermediate caches (like CDNs) to cache responses effectively.
    *   10.6. Performance Testing
        *   **Regular Load Testing:** Integrate load tests into the CI/CD pipeline (as described in Section 7) to catch performance regressions early.
        *   **Stress Testing:** Determine the breaking point of the application to understand its limits.
        *   **Soak Testing:** Run tests over extended periods to identify memory leaks or performance degradation under sustained load.
        *   **Profiling:** Use tools like Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools, PerfView, or Application Insights Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in the code.

11. **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity (DR/BC)**
    *   11.1. Objectives
        *   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Maximum acceptable downtime for the platform after a disaster event (e.g., < 4 hours).
        *   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time (e.g., < 15 minutes).
        *   These objectives drive the technical choices for backup, replication, and failover.
    *   11.2. Infrastructure Resiliency (Azure)
        *   **Availability Zones:** Deploy critical components (App Service Plans, Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, Redis Cache Premium) across multiple Availability Zones within a primary Azure region. This protects against data center failures within the region. Configure Azure SQL and Cosmos DB for zone redundancy.
        *   **Region Pairing:** Utilize Azure's paired region strategy for DR. The secondary region is geographically distant but connected via high-speed network.
    *   11.3. Data Backup & Recovery
        *   **Azure SQL Hyperscale:**
            *   **Backups:** Automatic, frequent log backups and periodic full/differential backups managed by Azure. Point-in-Time Restore (PITR) capability allows recovery to any point within the retention period (configurable, e.g., 7-35 days).
            *   **Geo-Replication (Optional but Recommended for DR):** Configure active geo-replication to maintain a readable secondary database in the paired Azure region. Allows for manual or potentially automated failover in case the primary region becomes unavailable. This significantly improves RTO compared to restoring from geo-backups.
Okay, completing the technical documentation for the CIBC Cross-Border Financial Insights Platform:

 

        *   **Cosmos DB (Continued):**
            *   **Multi-Region Writes / Geo-Replication (Continued):** Configure Cosmos DB account for multi-region distribution. This provides high availability and low latency reads globally. For DR, designate the paired region as a failover target. Failover can be manual or automatic (if configured, though manual is often preferred for control during a disaster). This provides a very low RPO (typically seconds/minutes) and low RTO.
    *   11.4. Application Tier Failover
        *   **Azure App Service:** Deploy the application to App Service Plans in both the primary and secondary (paired) regions.
        *   **Azure Front Door / Traffic Manager:** Use a global load balancing service like Azure Front Door (preferred for layer 7 features like WAF, SSL offloading, path-based routing) or Azure Traffic Manager (DNS-based) configured with health probes.
        *   **Failover Configuration:** Configure Front Door/Traffic Manager with priority routing. The primary region endpoint has higher priority. Health probes monitor the primary region's `/healthz` endpoint. If the primary region becomes unhealthy, traffic is automatically redirected to the secondary region's endpoint.
        *   **Configuration Synchronization:** Ensure application configuration (via Azure App Configuration with geo-replication or Key Vault) is available in the secondary region.
    *   11.5. Dependency Failover
        *   **Azure Cache for Redis:** If using Premium tier, configure geo-replication to the paired region for faster recovery. For Standard/Basic, rely on redeploying/rehydrating the cache in the secondary region during failover (accepting potential performance impact or data loss depending on cache usage).
        *   **Azure Key Vault:** Key Vault is inherently region-resilient for read operations if the primary region fails (data is replicated). For full DR including write availability, consider patterns involving vaults in multiple regions if absolutely critical, though often relying on Azure's resilience is sufficient.
        *   **Azure Machine Learning:** Ensure ML models and endpoints are deployable or already deployed in the secondary region. Consider model retraining/deployment pipelines that target both regions.
        *   **Other External Services:** Analyze DR capabilities of any other critical external dependencies and plan accordingly (e.g., secondary endpoints, data replication).
    *   11.6. DR Testing & Procedures
        *   **Regular Testing:** Conduct periodic DR tests (e.g., annually or semi-annually) involving a simulated primary region failure and failover to the secondary region. Test application functionality and validate RTO/RPO targets.
        *   **Failback Plan:** Document and test the procedure for failing back to the primary region once it's restored.
        *   **Runbooks:** Maintain detailed DR runbooks outlining step-by-step procedures for failover and failback, including communication plans and role assignments.

12. **Operational Procedures & Support**
    *   12.1. Deployment Process
        *   **Standard Deployments:** Follow CI/CD pipeline procedures (Section 7), including approvals for Staging/Production.
        *   **Hotfixes:** Define an expedited process for deploying critical bug fixes, potentially bypassing some non-essential gates (like full regression E2E tests) but still requiring security scans and critical approvals. Requires careful risk assessment.
        *   **Rollback Procedures:** Document steps for manual rollback using Azure DevOps release pipelines or Azure portal/CLI (e.g., swap deployment slots back, redeploy previous artifact version).
    *   12.2. Monitoring & Incident Response
        *   **On-Call Rotation:** Define on-call schedule and responsibilities for production support.
        *   **Alert Triage:** Document procedures for receiving, acknowledging, and triaging alerts from Azure Monitor (Section 9). Define severity levels and corresponding expected response times.
        *   **Troubleshooting Guides:** Develop guides for common issues (e.g., diagnosing high latency, investigating failed transactions, handling database connection pool exhaustion). Link relevant Azure Monitor dashboards and KQL queries.
        *   **Escalation Paths:** Define clear escalation paths for unresolved issues (e.g., Level 1 Ops -> Level 2 Dev Team -> Level 3 Architects/External Vendors).
        *   **Post-Mortems:** Conduct blameless post-mortems for significant incidents to identify root causes and implement preventative measures.
    *   12.3. Backup & Restore Procedures
        *   Document steps for performing database restores (PITR, full restore) using the Azure portal or CLI/PowerShell for both Azure SQL and Cosmos DB. Include validation steps post-restore.
    *   12.4. Access Management
        *   **Onboarding/Offboarding:** Procedures for granting and revoking access to Azure resources and the application itself, integrated with Azure AD/Entra ID group management.
        *   **Access Reviews:** Conduct periodic reviews (e.g., quarterly) of user roles and permissions (especially privileged roles) in Azure and within the application, leveraging Azure AD Access Reviews.
    *   12.5. Patching & Maintenance
        *   **Azure PaaS:** Azure manages underlying infrastructure patching for PaaS services (App Service, SQL, Cosmos DB).
        *   **Application Dependencies:** Regularly update NuGet and NPM packages using SCA tools (Section 7.5) to patch vulnerabilities. Schedule updates during maintenance windows.
        *   **.NET / Node.js Runtimes:** Update base images or App Service runtime versions as new LTS versions are released and security patches become available.

13. **Future Considerations & Roadmap**
    *   13.1. Potential Enhancements
        *   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Explore migrating certain workflows (e.g., post-transaction processing, notifications) to an event-driven model using Azure Event Grid or Azure Service Bus for better decoupling and scalability.
        *   **Advanced AI/ML:** Integrate more sophisticated ML models for predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting transaction volumes, predicting settlement times) or enhanced anomaly detection beyond basic fraud rules.
        *   **Self-Service Analytics:** Provide more advanced, potentially self-service reporting capabilities for analysts using Power BI Embedded features or direct data access (with appropriate controls).
        *   **GraphQL API:** Consider offering a GraphQL endpoint alongside or instead of REST for more flexible data fetching from the frontend, especially for complex dashboards.
        *   **Chaos Engineering:** Implement controlled chaos experiments (using tools like Azure Chaos Studio) in pre-production environments to proactively test system resilience.
    *   13.2. Technology Updates
        *   **.NET Upgrades:** Plan for migration to future .NET LTS versions (.NET 10, etc.) to leverage performance improvements, new features, and maintain support.
        *   **Frontend Framework Evolution:** Monitor evolutions in the React ecosystem (e.g., Server Components) and UI libraries.
        *   **Azure Service Updates:** Stay informed about new Azure features or services that could benefit the platform (e.g., new database tiers, improved monitoring capabilities).
    *   13.3. Scalability Bottlenecks
        *   Continuously monitor potential future bottlenecks as transaction volume grows (e.g., specific database queries, dependency limits, Cosmos DB hot partitions) and plan optimizations proactively.
